The file itself is hosted in the `Github repository <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs.json>`_. The list stretches back as far as version 0.3.0, bugs known to be present only in versions preceding that are not listed."

If there is no match, then the bug is very likely not present. If there is a match, the bug might be present.  For improved accuracy, the checks should be applied to the source code after stripping comments. The second type of check are patterns to be checked on the compact AST of the Solidity program (\"ast-compact-json-path\"). The specified search query is a `JsonPath <https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath>`_ expression. If at least one path of the Solidity AST matches the query, the bug is likely present."
