"Solidity is a `curly-bracket language "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type"
"#Curly-bracket_languages>`_ that has been influenced and inspired by "
"several well-known programming languages."

"Solidity is most profoundly influenced by C++, but also borrowed concepts"
" from languages like Python, JavaScript, and others."

"The influence from C++ can be seen in the syntax for variable "
"declarations, for loops, the concept of overloading functions, implicit "
"and explicit type conversions and many other details."

"In the early days of the language, Solidity used to be partly influenced "
"by JavaScript. This was due to function-level scoping of variables and "
"the use of the keyword ``var``. The JavaScript influence was reduced "
"starting from version 0.4.0. Now, the main remaining similarity to "
"JavaScript is that functions are defined using the keyword ``function``. "
"Solidity also supports import syntax and semantics that are similar to "
"those available in JavaScript. Besides those points, Solidity looks like "
"most other curly-bracket languages and has no major JavaScript influence "
"anymore."

"Another influence to Solidity was Python. Solidity's modifiers were added"
" trying to model Python's decorators with a much more restricted "
"functionality. Furthermore, multiple inheritance, C3 linearization, and "
"the ``super`` keyword are taken from Python as well as the general "
"assignment and copy semantics of value and reference types."
