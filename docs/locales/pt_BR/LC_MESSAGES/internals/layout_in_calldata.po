"The input data for a function call is assumed to be in the format defined"
" by the :ref:`ABI specification <ABI>`. Among others, the ABI "
"specification requires arguments to be padded to multiples of 32 bytes. "
"The internal function calls use a different convention."

"Arguments for the constructor of a contract are directly appended at the "
"end of the contract's code, also in ABI encoding. The constructor will "
"access them through a hard-coded offset, and not by using the "
"``codesize`` opcode, since this of course changes when appending data to "
"the code."
